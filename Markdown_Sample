A Second Level Header

+ Candy.

* A list item.
With multiple paragraphs.

I strongly recommend against using any `<blink>` tags.

I wish SmartyPants used named entities like `&mdash;`

If you want your page to validate under XHTML 1.0 Strict,
you've got to put paragraph tags in your blockquotes:

<blockquote>
<p>For example.</p>
</blockquote>
A single backtick in a code span: `` ` ``

A backtick-delimited string in a code span: `` `foo` ``

`` There is a literal backtick (`) here.``
